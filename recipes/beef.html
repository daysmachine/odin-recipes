    <h2>Corned Beef and Cabbage I</h2>
    <p>What's more Irish than a traditional recipe for corned beef and cabbage? Serve with mustard or horseradish if
        desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
        <li>5 carrots, peeled and cut into 3-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large head cabbage, cut into small wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place corned beef in large pot or Dutch oven and cover with water. Add the spice packet that came with the
            corned beef. Cover pot and bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer approximately 50 minutes per
            pound or until tender.</li>
        <li>Add whole potatoes and carrots, and cook until the vegetables are almost tender. Add cabbage and cook for 15
            more minutes. Remove meat and let rest 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place vegetables in a bowl and cover. Add as much broth (cooking liquid reserved in the Dutch oven or large
            pot) as you want. Slice meat across the grain.</li>
    </ol>
